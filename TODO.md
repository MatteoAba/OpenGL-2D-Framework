# To Do List

* Add Batch Rendering (Dynamic VBO/IBO + Vertex Structure + Quads Utility + Text Rendering Integration)
    - Why with maxQuadCount = 100 crash?
    - Add Batch Renderer ImGui Staistics
    - Implement Texture Atlas with Sampler 2D Array
    - Extend Sampler 2D Array to return the correct u/v coordinates
* Disable ImGUI in Release Mode or with an Application Variable (Move viewport in ImGui Layer and make a Setter in Application Class)
* Setup Initial ImGUI Viewport Size
* Audio System
* ECS
* Fix bleeding for traditional atlas
* Add Scroll to Camera Controller
